This package allows you to attach files to your sequelize instances as easy as you set your plain attributes and define MIME type validation and post-processing rules next to your models.

## Requirements
- [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) (`brew install imagemagick` on OS X).


## Usage
First, you define which fileds you want to enhance with attachments logic:

```javascript
/* models/attachments.js */

import SequelizeFile from 'sequelize-file';

export const picture = SequelizeFile({
   attribute: 'picture',
   mimetype: /^image/,
   crop: true,
   sizes: {
     small: 64, //width 64
     big: 150, //width 150
   }
});

export const backgroundImage = SequelizeFile({
  attribute: 'backgroundImage',
  mimetype: /^image/,
  crop: true,
  sizes: {
    preview: "x350" // height 350
  }
});

```
Then, you attach enhanced attributes to your model:

```javascript
/* models/User.js */

import sequelize from './db';
import { STRING } from 'sequelize';
import { picture, backgroundImage } from './attachments';

let User = sequelize.define('user', {
  name: STRING,
  /* And all of your plain sequelize attributes... */
});

picture.addTo(User);
backgroundImage.addTo(User);

export default User;

```

After this, you'll be able to set files just as ordinary sequelize attributes. You can attach files either as urls (they will be downloaded), or as pre-downloaded [multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer)-style objects (basically, only `path` and `mimetype` props are required)

```javascript

sequelize.sync({ force: true }).then(() => {

  // If you set url, file will be downloaded and saved
  let user1 = User.build({
    picture: "http://example.com/somepic.jpg"
  });

  user1.save();

  // Or you can pass multer-style File object, for example
  let user2 = User.build({
    picture: "http://example.com/somepic2.jpg",
    backgroundImage: {
      path: '/uploads/tmp/somepic.jpg',
      mimetype: 'image/jpeg'
    }
  });

  user2.save()

  // Deleting file(s)
  user2.update({ picture: null });

});

```
You access all of your resized images through dot notation. If you didn't setup resizing, you'll get a string path to attached file.

```javascript

User.findById(1)
.then(user => {
  console.log(user.picture.small);
  console.log(user.picture.big);
  console.log(user.picture.original);
});

```

## Status

This package is under early development. Do use it with caution!
